## Why This Exists

Because apparently, trillion-dollar tech companies can't figure out how to make a smart home assistant that isn't dumber than a bag of hot sheep farts. :sheep:

### The Problem

- **Google**: "OK Google, turn off the kitchen lights."
  - Google: "I'm sorry, I don't know how to turn off kitchen lights. Would you like me to search the web for 'kitchen light switch locations'?"

- **Apple**: "Siri, set an alarm for 7 AM."
  - Siri: "OK, playing 'P Diddy Suck a d***' by Tonny's Hot Spunklights on Disney+."

- **Alexa**: "Alexa, what's the weather like today?"
  - Alexa: "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Did you ask about you recent order of used hamster tampons?"

## The Solution

I'm just gonna do it myself. Because waiting for Google to deliver is like waiting for the pizza  guy to bring you that pizza you ordered 2 days ago. "It's not coming buddy...let it go." :pizza: :cry:

### Features

- **Actually understands basic commands** 🎉
- **Doesn't try to sell you shit every 5 seconds** :moneybag:
- **Won't accidentally play Cardi B. WAP when my 3 year old asks for Handyman Hal corn videos** :corn: :eyes:
- **Customizable to your heart's content** (or until you break everything) 🛠️
