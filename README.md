# DeLoHOME: Because Big Tech Can't Get Their Sh*t Together

Welcome to DeLoHOME, the last bastion of sanity in the cesspool of "smart" home automation. If you're here, you've probably had enough of talking to your house like you're ordering at a drive-thru with a broken speaker.

## Why DeLoHOME?

Because apparently, in 2024, we still can't get a freaking AI to understand basic human speech. You know, that thing we've been doing for thousands of years? Yeah, that.

### Features:

- Doesn't confuse "turn off alarms" with "play P Diddy's greatest hits at full volume at 3 AM"
- Actually understands numbers without a PhD in advanced calculus
- Won't set random alarms when you're just trying to watch a damn YouTube video

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Pray to the tech gods
3. Sacrifice a rubber duck
4. Run `setup.sh` and hope for the best

## Usage

Just talk like a normal human being. Crazy concept, right?

Example:
```bash
You: "Hey DeLoHOME, turn off the lights."
DeLoHOME: *Actually turns off the lights*
You: *Shocked Pikachu face*
```

We're not really looking for contributions. This is a personal project. If you have ideas, sure, open an issue. But don't expect any code from me.
